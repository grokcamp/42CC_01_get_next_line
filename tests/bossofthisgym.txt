1	Hey buddy, I think you've got the wrong door;
2	The leather club's two blocks down.
3	F*** you.
4	Nah, f*** you, leather-man.
5	Maybe you and I should settle it right here on the ring, if you think you're that tough.
6	Oh yeah?
7	Yeah, you gonna wrestle or what?
8	I'll kick your ass!
9	Get outta the way man!
10	Let's go!
11	Why don't you get out of that leather stuff?
12	I'll strip down out of this, and we'll settle it right here in the ring.
13	What do you say?
14	Yeah?
15	No problem, buddy.
16	You got it.
17	Get outta that, uh, jabroni outfit.
18	Yeah, smart-ass.
19	I'll show you who's boss of this gym.
20	*Locker slams*
21	COME ON!
22	LET'S GO!
